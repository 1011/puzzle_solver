# puzzle_solver
Python Code which generates an nXn matrix of spaces in a GUI window, uses BFS to identify a valid solution to the randomly generated puzzle, and then uses local search techniques (hill climbing, random walk, random restarts, simulated annealing, and population based methods) to modify the puzzle to become more difficult.
